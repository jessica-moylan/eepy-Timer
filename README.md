# eepy-Timer
SBU HopperHacks 2024

For this project, we wanted to focus on your sleeping habits and limiting your screen time before bed. This made PalWare a cute chrome extention that helps you keep to these goals. As college students its important to go to bed before midnight so make sure that time doesn't get too close. 

Throughout the day, eepy gives you great health advice such as "drink water!" or "take a break from studying" but as it gets closer to midnight eepy gets a bit upset.
